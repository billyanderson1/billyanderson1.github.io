<p>Landlines, or standard phone systems, are normally supported by a regional or regional  phone service provider and use public changed telephone networks (PSTNs) to transmit voice information. At ALINK, our VOIP business telephone systems can change the whole nature of customer support at your company. As internet speeds and capacities boost and technologies and costs improve, increasingly more businesses are cutting the cable from standard phone systems.</p>

<p>The Panasonic KX-TES824 is a hybrid office telephone system that can support approximately 24 extensions. A VoIP trunk solution for the forward-thinking business choosing to self-manage their voice, data, and Internet traffic.

<p>However, VoIP providers offer internet-based call connectivity without requiring making use of video messaging services or other outlets. It's just one cable television to the desk you have with VoIP systems. The more users you get, the more you require to depend on smart phones instead of devoted hardware.

<p>Rather of utilizing standard phone lines, VoIP technology works with linked online networks and digitalizes analog voice calls and messages to send interactions to and from different parties.
