<p>The key distinction between PBX and VoIP is that in the event of a power interruption, and no internet, a PBX phone system usually has an uninterruptible power supply, and utilizes the general public switched telephone network (PSTN). From small business VoIP providers to business VoIP phone systems, every business phone service has a various list of feature sets, and prices. Calls between VoIP and the analogue network are enabled by equipment (such as Media Gateways) creating connections in between them.</p>
<p>Another excellent reason to opt for a Hosted VoIP System is that having a redundancy strategy in location is a lot more useful and cost effective when your system resides in the cloud. This allows your PBX system to reside on your information network, producing a walled garden that reduces jitter and latency that may occur when calls go over the public Internet. IP phones include desk phones, cordless phones, and conference phones that resemble your everyday office phone, but utilize a different innovation for powering calls.</p>
