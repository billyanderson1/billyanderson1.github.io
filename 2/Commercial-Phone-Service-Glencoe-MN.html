<p>Moreover, the possibility of carrying out VoIP software in web internet browsers and servers provides a more efficient and competitive edge to e-commerce and customer care applications. VoIP technology sends your voice as digital information online, while regular phones utilize analog signals along the general public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). VoIP protocols transform voice signals (phone calls), files (fax) or messages (SMS text) into packets from a sender and reassemble those packets for compatible receivers.</p>
