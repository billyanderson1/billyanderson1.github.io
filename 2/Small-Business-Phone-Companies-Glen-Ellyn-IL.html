<p>Share one telephone number across numerous phones, and respond to calls from any phone. Primary telephone service providers are providing information services such as automatic number recognition, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it easier to add brand-new services.

In the 1960s services had rotary dial telephones and typewriters, two independent pieces of innovation that served a special purpose; if we were to use comparable technology today we would quickly become obsolete.</p>
